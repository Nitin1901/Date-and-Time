# Date-and-Time

#### Many operations can be performed on date and time.

__Python provides a module `datetime` which contains many classes which include__ :-
+ `date`
+ `time`
+ `calendar`
+ `datetime`

and so on.

## Getting started
We get access to this module by importing it using, 
```python
import datetime
```

After importing this module and a specific Class of our requirement, we create an instance of this Class by initialising an object.
We use various methods associated with that object to perform the tast.

Usually, while importing the module, we import the class also.
```python
from datetime import date
```

__Basic operations like__
* Comparison
* Arithmetic operations
* Date difference.

can be performed.
